# Write an angry boss program that rudely asks what you want. Whatever you
# answer, the angry boss should yell it back to you and then fire you. For
# example, if you type in I want a raise, it should yell back like this:
#
# WHADDAYA MEAN "I WANT A RAISE"?!? YOU'RE FIRED!!

puts "Boss: What the hell do you want?"
emp_response =  "I WANT " + gets.chomp
puts 'Boss: WHADDAYA MEAN "' + emp_response.upcase + '"?!? YOU\'RE FIRED!!'
